   Currently it saves middle exchange rates from Table A & B (from NBP api) in pln_mid_exchange table in local database
   and bid & ask exchange rates from Table C (from NBP api) in pln_exchange table in local database.
   it stores exchange rates for the last 10 data series.
   it load initial data only if local table is empty. it usage file based H2 database. Database can be found in `data` folder in root of project.
